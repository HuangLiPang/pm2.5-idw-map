<h2>Note</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The data presented here are collected using low-cost PM2.5 sensors, which may result in different results to professional instruments. The calibration model between low-cost sensors and professional instruments is still an open challenge to the research field, and we will apply such calibration models to the dataset once it becomes available.</li>
  <li>It has been verified that the intra-model variability (IMV) of the low-cost sensors used in the data collection is below 5%, which is acceptable for data comparison and analysis works. Moreover, it has been shown that the low-cost sensors used in the data collection follows the same trend of professional instruments very well in many studies.</li>
  <li>The data presented here is intended for data collection and visualization only. When using the dataset for any research, analysis, and other purposes, please do not over-claim its applications. For more accurate air quality information, please refer to official data sources of the corresponding areas.</li>
